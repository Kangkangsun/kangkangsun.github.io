IEEE P21451-1-5 standard specifies a universal and standardized way of accessing and managing the Internet of Things (IoT) based on a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). In this article, we explain the basic concepts of IEEE P1451, provide an overview of the IEEE P21451-1-5 standard and introduce the demonstration system to be presented in INTEROP 2020, including its building blocks, overall structure and the workflow of IEEE P21451-1-5 in this demonstration system.
