# A Short Introduction
I'm a four-year PhD student under the supervision of Prof. [Jianhua Li](https://infosec.sjtu.edu.cn/TeamDetail.aspx?id=9) at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I finished my master's degree at Jilin University in 2017.

My previous research direction is the security of IoV and IoT, Data Security, Digital Twin (DT), and Distributed Machine Learning Security, including Federated Learning (FL), Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), Game Theory, etc.

Current research interests are Data Security and Privacy, Tradeoffs in Federated Learning (privacy, utility, fairness and communication), Game Theory in Machine Learning, and Applications in IoV and IoT.
